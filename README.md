**Loan Prediction** 
+ The loan prediction model assesses applicants' eligibility by analyzing their loan application details. Using advanced algorithms, it evaluates factors such as credit score, financial history, income, and employment status. By processing this data, the model accurately predicts the likelihood of an applicant's eligibility for a loan, enabling efficient and informed lending decisions for financial institutions.Student at SRM Institute of Science and Technology - Kattankulathur Campus
